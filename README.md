# BD1_DCAF16

A collection of scripts for calculating the binding free energy of the DCAF16-BD2 protein complex. The free energy change is calculated via the path-based geometric route (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0409005102), with umbrella sampling being used to calculate the free energy change at each stage of the thermodynamic cycle. The MD engine used for all simulations is OpenMM.
